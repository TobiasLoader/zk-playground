## zk-playground

Playground to explore zero-knowledge proving systems.

### [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)
*This is a JavaScript and Pure Web Assembly implementation of zkSNARK and PLONK schemes. It uses the Groth16 Protocol (3 point only and 3 pairings), PLONK and FFLONK. [...] This library uses the compiled circuits generated by the circom compiler.*

### [Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir)
*Noir is a Domain Specific Language for SNARK proving systems. It has been designed to use any ACIR compatible proving system.*

### [Cairo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo)
*Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation.*

### [Nexus](https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm)
*The Nexus zkVM is a modular, extensible, open-source, and highly-parallelized zkVM, designed to run at a trillion CPU cycles proved per second given enough machine power.*
